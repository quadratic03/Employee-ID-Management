This file serves as a placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be a JPEG or PNG image file that will be used as the company logo throughout the application.

For implementation, replace this text file with an actual image file named 'logo.png' in this same directory.

Recommended dimensions for the logo image: 200x60 pixels with transparent background.
