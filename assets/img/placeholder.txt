This file serves as a placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be a JPEG or PNG image file that will be used as a default placeholder for employee photos when no photo is uploaded.

For implementation, replace this text file with an actual image file named 'placeholder.jpg' in this same directory.

Recommended dimensions for the placeholder image: 150x180 pixels.
