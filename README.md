#### Sample Image Display
Here's how employee photos appear in the system:

![Employee Photo Sample](assets/img/screenshots/employee-photo-sample.png)

### Displaying Images in the System
To display images properly within the system, use the following methods:

#### 1. Displaying Employee Photos
```php
// Display employee photo with image viewer
$photoPath = !empty($employee['photo']) ? '../' . $employee['photo'] : '../assets/img/placeholder.jpg';
echo '<img src="' . $photoPath . '" class="employee-photo" alt="' . $employee['fullname'] . '" onclick="openImageViewer(this)">';
```

#### 2. Displaying Images in ID Cards
```php
// In ID card templates, use the placeholder:
<img src="{PHOTO_PATH}" alt="Employee Photo" class="id-photo">

// The system will automatically replace it with:
<img src="../uploads/photos/employee123.jpg" alt="Employee Photo" class="id-photo">
```

#### 3. Using the Image Viewer API
```javascript
// Open the image viewer for a specific image
function openImageViewer(imgElement) {
    ImageViewer.show(imgElement.src, {
        zoomable: true,
        rotatable: true,
        downloadable: true
    });
}

// Open multiple images as a gallery
function openGallery(employeeId) {
    ImageViewer.showGallery(employeeId, {
        startIndex: 0,
        navigable: true
    });
}
```

#### 4. Image Paths Reference
Common image paths in the system:
- Employee photos: `../uploads/photos/[filename]`
- System logos: `../assets/img/logo.png`
- Default placeholders: `../assets/img/placeholder.jpg`
- ID card templates: `../uploads/templates/[template_id]/background.jpg`

## Security Recommendations

1. Always use HTTPS for secure data transmission
2. Change the default admin password immediately
3. Regularly backup your database
4. Set up proper file permissions
5. Consider implementing rate limiting for verification requests
6. Enable login attempt restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### ID Card Printing Issues
- If ID cards print at wrong size, ensure browser scaling is set to 100%
- For blank printouts, check if your browser is blocking images or scripts
- If QR codes don't scan, try increasing their size in the template

### Document Verification Issues
- If documents cannot be verified, check the verification code for typos
- Ensure the document hasn't expired
- Verify the document hasn't been marked as invalidated in the system
