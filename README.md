## Customization

### ID Card Templates
You can customize ID card templates by:
1. Accessing the Templates section in the admin panel
2. Creating a new template or editing an existing one
3. Using HTML for layout and CSS for styling
4. Testing the template before applying it to employees

Available placeholder tags for templates:
- `{FULL_NAME}` - Employee's full name
- `{POSITION}` - Employee's position/rank
- `{DEPARTMENT}` - Employee's department
- `{ID_NUMBER}` - Unique ID number
- `{ISSUE_DATE}` - ID card issue date
- `{EXPIRY_DATE}` - ID card expiry date
- `{PHOTO_PATH}` - Path to employee's photo
- `{QR_CODE}` - QR code for verification

### System Branding
Replace the logo file at `assets/img/logo.png` with your own logo.

## Security Recommendations

1. Always use HTTPS for secure data transmission
2. Change the default admin password immediately
3. Regularly backup your database
4. Set up proper file permissions
5. Consider implementing rate limiting for verification requests
6. Enable login attempt restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### ID Card Printing Issues
- If ID cards print at wrong size, ensure browser scaling is set to 100%
- For blank printouts, check if your browser is blocking images or scripts
- If QR codes don't scan, try increasing their size in the template

### Document Verification Issues
- If documents cannot be verified, check the verification code for typos
- Ensure the document hasn't expired
- Verify the document hasn't been marked as invalidated in the system
